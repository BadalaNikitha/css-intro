A selector is a pattern used in CSS to target HTML elements you want to style.
<p>Hello World!</p>
CSS:-
  p {
  color: red;
}
Here, p is the selector. It selects all <p> elements and makes their text red.
The main types of CSS selectors are:

Element / Type Selector – selects elements by their tag name (e.g., p, div).

Class Selector – selects elements by class (e.g., .classname).

ID Selector – selects an element by its ID (e.g., #idname).

Universal Selector – selects all elements (*).

Group Selector – selects multiple elements together (e.g., h1, p, div).
